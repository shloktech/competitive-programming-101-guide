Hello and welcome to this repo. In it, I will be adding how to become a good competitive programmer from scratch.

Who am I? I am Shlok a 5 Star Coder on CodeChef with a global rank of around 250 and an India rank of around 150 and my Max rating is 2182. On LeetCode I am in the top 7% of the coders and have solved more than 1100 questions.

My profiles:
CodeChef: https://www.codechef.com/users/shlok_t
LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/u/shlok_t/

So now let's get started :)

Becoming a good competitive programmer requires dedication, practice, and a strategic approach to learning and problem-solving. Here are some steps and tips to help you on your journey:

### 1. **Start with the Basics**
- **Learn a Programming Language**: Choose a language that's commonly used in competitive programming, such as C++, Python, or Java. C++ is often preferred due to its Standard Template Library (STL) which is very useful.
- **Understand Basic Data Structures and Algorithms**: Make sure you are comfortable with arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, and basic sorting and searching algorithms.

### 2. **Practice Regularly**
- **Join Online Platforms**: Websites like Codeforces, CodeChef, LeetCode, AtCoder, HackerRank, and TopCoder offer a wide range of problems and contests.
- **Solve Problems**: Start with easier problems and gradually move to more difficult ones. Consistency is key, so try to solve a few problems every day.

### 3. **Learn Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms**
- **Dive Deeper**: Study more complex data structures like segment trees, Fenwick trees, tries, and disjoint-set unions (DSU).
- **Algorithms**: Learn about dynamic programming, graph algorithms (like Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall), backtracking, and bit manipulation.

### 4. **Participate in Contests**
- **Regular Contests**: Participate in regular online contests on platforms like Codeforces, CodeChef, and AtCoder. This helps you get used to the competitive environment.
- **Virtual Contests**: If you miss a live contest, many platforms allow you to participate in it virtually later on.

### 5. **Analyze and Learn from Mistakes**
- **Contest Analysis**: After each contest, spend time analyzing your solutions as well as the top solutions. Understand where you went wrong and how you can improve.
- **Debugging**: Develop strong debugging skills. This will help you quickly identify and fix issues during contests.

### 6. **Study Competitive Programming Resources**
- **Books**: Consider reading books like "Competitive Programming" by Steven Halim and Felix Halim, "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein, and "The Art of Computer Programming" by Donald Knuth.
- **Tutorials and Blogs**: Follow tutorials and blogs by experienced competitive programmers. Many top coders share their strategies and solutions.

### 7. **Join a Community**
- **Forums and Groups**: Engage with communities on platforms like Codeforces, Reddit, or Discord. Discuss problems, solutions, and strategies with peers.
- **Mentorship**: If possible, find a mentor who can guide you and help you improve faster.

### 8. **Improve Time Management and Problem-Solving Speed**
- **Timely Practice**: During practice sessions, time yourself to simulate contest conditions.
- **Prioritize Problems**: Learn to quickly identify which problems to attempt first during a contest. Start with the easier problems to secure quick points.

### 9. **Stay Updated and Adaptable**
- **Learn New Techniques**: Competitive programming evolves, with new techniques and algorithms constantly emerging. Stay updated with the latest trends and techniques.
- **Adapt**: Be flexible in your approach to problems. Sometimes unconventional methods or creative thinking can lead to solutions.

### 10. **Maintain a Balanced Routine**
- **Healthy Lifestyle**: Ensure you get enough rest, exercise, and maintain a healthy diet. A fresh and focused mind performs better.
- **Avoid Burnout**: Take breaks and avoid over-practicing. Quality of practice is more important than quantity.

### Resources for Competitive Programming

- **Online Judges**: Codeforces, CodeChef, LeetCode, AtCoder, TopCoder, HackerRank, SPOJ, UVa Online Judge.
- **Books**: "Competitive Programming" by Steven Halim and Felix Halim, "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein, "The Art of Computer Programming" by Donald Knuth.
- **Websites**: GeeksforGeeks, HackerEarth, CP-Algorithms, TopCoder Tutorials.
- **YouTube Channels**: Gaurav Sen, William Lin, Errichto, Kunal Kushwaha, CodeNCode.

By following these steps and utilizing the resources mentioned, you'll be well on your way to becoming a proficient competitive programmer. Good luck!
